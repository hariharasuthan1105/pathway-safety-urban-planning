[![Hackathon Event Name](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hackathon-The%20Urban%20Innovation%20Challenge-blue.svg)]()
[![Status: Prototype](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Prototype-red.svg)]()

## üåü The Problem

* **What is the core issue?** (e.g., "City-wide waste management is inefficient, leading to over-full bins and wasted resources.")
* **Why is it a problem?** (e.g., "This results in higher operational costs and lower public satisfaction.")

## ‚ú® Our Solution: [Project Name]

> **[Project Name]** is a **[brief, exciting one-sentence description]**. We use **[core technology]** to deliver **[main benefit]**.

**[BIG GIF/DEMO VIDEO LINK HERE: A short, compelling demo is the most important part of a hackathon README.]**

### Core Features (What We Built)

* **Real-time Data Dashboard:** Displays live sensor data for optimal route planning.
* **Predictive AI Model:** Forecasts bin fill-levels with 95% accuracy to schedule pickups.
* **User Interface:** Simple, one-click interface for sanitation workers to report status.

### The Innovation / Why We Win

This section is for the judges to see your unique value.

* **Unique Approach:** We're the first to integrate **[Specific API/Dataset]** with a **[Specific ML model type]**.
* **Immediate Impact:** Our model suggests a **25% reduction** in fuel consumption in a pilot area.
* **Clarity & Focus:** We stayed strictly within the **[Hackathon Challenge Theme]**.
